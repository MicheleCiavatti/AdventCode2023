# AdventCode2023
Trying to complete the Advent in C. <br/>
![An old language, I know](img/older_code.jpg)<br/>
Code probably won't be optimazed in any way: the rule is "as long as it works!".<br/>
Compile every solution with <code>gcc -std=c99 -Wpedantic -Wall solution.c -o solution</code><br/>
Run with <code>./solution.exe</code>
